# Chess_Newbie

Wrote a Chess AI using Alpha Beta pruning

## How to play

Make sure you have python and pip installed. Run these commands
```
pip install python-chess
git clone https://github.com/luohoward/Chess_Newbie.git
python main.py
```

You will always play white and the bot will always play black. The intent of using Zobrist hashing is to prevent the bot from recomputing old moves that it has computed already

## Thanks
Sunfish for supplying me with the PST values, python-chess for making me not have to write chess
