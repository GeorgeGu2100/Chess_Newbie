Wrote a Chess AI using Alpha Beta pruning

## How to play

Make sure you have python and pip installed. Run this command
```
pip install python-chess
```

Then afterwards run main.py. You will always play white and the bot will always play black. The intent of using Zobrist hashing is to prevent the bot from recomputing old moves that it has computed already
